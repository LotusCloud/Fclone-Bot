- Copy all mails from \accounts\emails.txt and paste in 'Group members' field, then press 'Add Members'

- open your SHARED DRIVE and add this  [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/my-groups) (it will be something like `your@googlegroups.com`) as 'Content Manager'. Done!

- Don't forget delete emails.txt in your local drive


#### Alternative

- add all the service accounts to your team drive by running this:

```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d YourSharedDriveID
```

- If this does not work use 

```
python add_to_team_drive.py -d YourSharedDriveID
